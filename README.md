I made a test that contains four seprate questions with four seprate answers. The answers are multiple choice, and when you click on the Correct answer
a prompt will show  on the screen and telling us that the answer we selected was correct. Same applies for getting the answer wrong, if the user gets the answer
wrong the prompt will pop up on the screen and tell the user the answer they selected was wrong. When an answer is wrong the test will subtract ten seconds from the timer.
I also have a high score function where the code will check local storage if there is already a high score if not it will display the players score as the new high score since there isnt one.
But if the user refershes the page the previous high score will be logged and if his score isnt higher then the set high score it wont log his score since its not greater. Theres also a submit button where you can input your name so it can save your highscore in local storage.
